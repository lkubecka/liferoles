	How to use this application
  </div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
  <h2>1) Determine your roles</h2>
  <p>In this time management system each task is linked with your role. Think of role as about your position to other people or to yourself. You could play for example these roles: <em>father, husband, manager, lector, sportsman</em>. Think about your own and then create them in <b>Roles</b> section of this application.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>2) Understand week planning</h2>
  <p>You probably already met planing system like calendars or daily planed TO-DO lists. This one differs from them - in this system you will plan in week cycles.</p>
  <p>It is not a good idea to work hard without rest all the working week and then spent two days half-dead on the couch. To be productive you definitely must work but you also must rest and find a time for your relationships. With week planing it is easy to satisfy all your roles and that's the key factor for your productivity, happiness and personal growth.</p>
  <p>Find your time for planing for example at Sunday evening and try to write down all tasks for the next week. You can update your plan during the week, of course, but try to stick with it.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>3) Create tasks</h2>
  <p>Now you know everything to get started. Go to the <b>Tasks</b> section and start planing! :)</p>
  <h3>Weeks</h3>
  <p>At the top you see what week are you in. You can navigate through weeks by sliding over your display to the side.</p>
  <h3>Days menu</h3>
  <p>On the right you see menu with days. If you choose <b>Week</b> option you will see all tasks for that week. You can also filter tasks according to role above. If you choose any day you will see tasks for that day. When <b>day</b> is selected and task is created it is imidiately assigned to the selected date. When <b>week</b> is selected you have to specify date on your own.</p>
  <h3>Backlog</h3>
  <p>All tasks without specified date are in backlog. If you have some uncompleted tasks in the past you can use <span class="icon ion-archive"></span> button to automatically move them to backlog.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>4) Manage tasks</h2>
  <p>If you click on task you will see its details and you can for example mark it as important, add note or change its date.</p>
  <p>If you long click on the task (click and hold) you will be able to move task between days in current week or to/from backlog.</p>
  <p>If you finished your task make sure to mark is as finished in the checbox on the right.</p>

	Tips
  </div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
  <h2>Plan faster</h2>
  <p>If you are planning your week and have many tasks on your mind but dont know which task assign to which day create them in backlog. You can then drag and drop them into days you want really quickly.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Create role for unassignable tasks<h2>
  <p>You will probably soon realize that you cant assign role to all tasks. For example which role would you assign to task 'Buy socks'? It is recomended for you to create specific role, called for example: Other,Unassigned or TODO, which will handle these tasks.</p>
